# Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

A  **critical point**  in a linked list is defined as  **either**  a  **local maxima**  or a  **local minima**.

A node is a  **local maxima**  if the current node has a value  **strictly greater**  than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a  **local minima**  if the current node has a value  **strictly smaller**  than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists  **both**  a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return  *an array of length 2 containing* `[minDistance, maxDistance]` *where* `minDistance` *is the  **minimum distance**  between  **any two distinct**  critical points and* `maxDistance` *is the  **maximum distance**  between  **any two distinct**  critical points. If there are  **fewer**  than two critical points, return* `[-1, -1]`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [2, 105].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105
